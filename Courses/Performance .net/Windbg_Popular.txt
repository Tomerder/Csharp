.sympath srv*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols;cache*c:\SymbolsCache - Sets the symbol path (both symbols server and symbols cache) - each execution of this command will replace ALL the content of the symbols path definition.

.sympath+ [path as in the previous command] - Append a symbol path to the current symbol path settings

.symfix - Sets the default symbols path to the MS Symbols server

.reload - Reloads all the symbols from the symbol path defined.

.load sos - Loads an extension from a specific path (c:\temp\sos.dll)
.loadby sos clr (mscorwks) - Loads an extention by the path of an existing module (clr for .Net 4, mscorwks for .Net 2).

.chain - Prints the list of the currently loaded extensions

.unload sos - Unloads an extension called sos.

!objsize - Get the size of the object and all it's internal members
!gcroot - Get the path to this object from the application roots (statics, stacks, gc handles, finalization queue)

.foreach (obj {!dumpheap -mt 00007ff94d5881c8 -short}) {!objsize obj}
-- Go through all the objects in the heap with the specific MT, and get the object total size for all the instances

.foreach (obj {!dumpheap -mt 00007ff94d5881c8 -short}) {!gcroot obj}
-- Go through all the objects in the heap with the specific MT, and get path to the object from the application roots.

.shell -ci "!dumpdomain" FINDSTR mscorlib
-- Runs the dumpDomain command, and pipes the output to command shell with the FINDSTR (grep) to filter the results. 

~ - Get all the threads
!threads - Get all the managed threads

~*e !clrstack - Loop all the threads, and for each thread runs a command (in this case, !clrstack)

~7s - Change the current thread to 7
k - unmanaged stack
!CLRStack - managed stack (-a (all) - local variables, parameters)

!DumpStackObjects (!dso) - Prints all objects in the stack (private variables)

!dumpObj (!do) - Dumps an object content.

!dumpheap -stat  - Dumps a statistics view of all the types in the heap
!dumpheap -type [Type name] - Dumps all objects that are from the type passed as an argument (can be wildcard, i.e System.String)

!dumpheap -mt [MT] - Dumps all the objects in the heap that are of type that is equal to the argument been passed.

!dumpmt -md [MT] - Dump information of the method table, including all the methods and method descriptors.

!ip2md - Converts from an IP (instruction pointer - as you can find on the stacks) to a method descriptors which then can be used to get the assembly code, or IL.

!syncblk - Prints a summary for the Sync Block Table - especially usefull for deadlocks.

!finalizeQueue - Prints a statistics view of the content of the finalization queue
!dumparray [Obj] - Dumps the content of an array

!printException (!pe) - Prints the exception on the current thread
!dumpil [MD] - Dumps the IL code of the method the it's method descriptor been passed as argument.

!dumpDomain - Dumps the content of all the application domains including the modules loaded for each app domain.
!dumpModule -mt [Module adress] - Dumps the content of the types of module address been passed as an argument.

!TraverseHeap - Saves the heap data into a file (XML or binary) - which if it is binary, it can be opened from the CLR Profiler tool.
