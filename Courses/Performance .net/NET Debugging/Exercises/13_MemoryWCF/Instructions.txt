1. Run the MemoryExhaustingService.exe application from the Binaries folder.

2. Monitor its memory usage with Performance Monitor and make sure there is a memory leak. Explain why this is a managed memory leak.

3. Attach a debugger or take a hang dump of the application and inspect the objects in memory and their roots. (See previous exercises for a more detailed description of this process.)

4. Repeat step #3 multiple times after letting the memory leak accumulate. Determine the root cause for the problem---the fix that needs to be made in the application's source code or configuration so that the memory leak does not occur.

After completing this exercise, you might want to read the following post for a detailed diagnostic walkthrough of this situation:
